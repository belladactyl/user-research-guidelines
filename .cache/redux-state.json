A general understanding of statistics will help analyze results, but is not required.\n\n# Optional\nrelatedMethods:\n- text: Usability Test\n  url: /usability-test/\n\n---\n\n## What is an a/b test?\n\nAn a/b test is a method of comparing two versions of a webpage or app against each other to determine which one performs better. ab testing uses data and statistics to validate new design changes and improve conversion rates.\n\nA/B testing allows individuals, teams, and companies to make careful changes to their user experiences while collecting data on the results. This allows them to construct hypotheses and to better learn why certain elements of their experiences impact user behavior.\n\n## How to conduct an a/b test:\n\nA minimum of 20-25 users/interactions is recommended per iteration. The more the better!\n\nIf you are testing in person, prepare a script and always use the same script to keep the tests consistent. Test with one participant at a time to remove bias from questions and comparisons. ask the participant to think out loud so you will better understand their thought process. ask the participant why they selected a certain version.\n\nYou can also use a platform like [Usability Hub](https://usabilityhub.com/) to conduct a/b tests.\n\nCompare qualitative and quantitative data to determine which version performs better, then use the results to iterate on your product.",

Card sorts are useful in developing navigation, content organization, or menu structure based on real user feedback.

If you are performing a closed cart sort, write your pre- de ned categories on index cards as well. Keep a stack of blank cards handy to use during the session.\n\n## How to conduct an open card sort:\n\nAsk participants to organize topics into groups that make sense to them. Then ask them to come up with a label/category for each group that they feel accurately describes the content. ask the participant to think out loud as they make decisions.\n\n**You can conduct an open card sort when:**\n\n- You want to get ideas for labels for the site\n- You want to see how people understand information\n\n## How to conduct a closed card sort:\n\nAsk participants to organize topics into pre- de ned categories. Ask the participant to think out loud as they make decisions.\n\n**You can conduct a closed card sort when:**\n\n- You want to see how people think information  ts within an established structure\n- Validating results of an open card sort\n  \n## How to conduct a reverse card sort / tree test:\n\nParticipants are given tasks and asked to complete them by navigating a collection of cards. ask the participant to think out loud as they make decisions. Each card contains the names of subcategories related to a category, and the participant should  nd the card most relevant to the given task starting from the main card with the top-level categories.\n\nA reverse card sort validates the site  ow and organization of content and can be helpful in matching the navigation to users’ mental models.\n\n**You can conduct a reverse card sort / tree test when:**\n\n- Refactoring is needed due to user feedback\n- A site or section of a site is being redesigned\n- Validating changes to web site navigation\n\n## Documenting and interpreting card sort results:\n\nDocument the results of each sort with a picture for future analysis. You could also quickly summarize the groupings made by participants using the numbers on the cards. If you used software, no need to worry about this step!\n\nThe easiest way to make sense of the data generated from card sorting is to put the data into a spreadsheet to identify patterns — in particular, you will be able to see which cards were grouped together most often and how often cards were grouped into certain categories.\n\nTake comments participants made during the session into consideration as well.

Empathy maps can be used by teams to acknowledge pain points in a process or system a user might be experiencing that wouldn’t typically stand out.\n\n## How to create an empathy map:\n\nThink in  rst person from the user’s perspective. You can create an empathy map with real users if you have access to them, or do it with your project team going on assumptions.\n\nUsing this template, answer the following items from the perspective of your persona as they attempt to achieve their goal:\n\n1. Think/feel - what really counts, major preoccupations, worries/aspirations\n2. see - what the personas perceives from the people and in uences around them\n3. say/do - what is the persona saying/doing; how they interact with others, appearance\n4. Hear - what are coworkers saying, what are managers saying, what are clients saying, what are friends saying\n5. Pain - what are the persona’s obstacles, frustrations, fears\n6. gain - what are the persona’s wants and needs, obstacles, metrics of success\n\n## When to create an empathy map?\n\nYou should start creating empathy maps at the beginning of any project or major iteration of a project.\n\n## Why create an empathy map?\n\nEmpathy maps are valuable to teams in the early stages of a project by clearly depicting pain points in a process or system that currently exist and cause the user frustration. This allows the team to acknowledge those problems and create resolutions for them early in the project.",

      "rawMarkdownBody": "\n## What is an empathy map?\n\nAn empathy map is a visual and interactive method of understanding how a user or user group thinks and feels when working to achieve a goal. Empathy maps can be used by teams to acknowledge pain points in a process or system a user might be experiencing that wouldn’t typically stand out.\n\n## How to create an empathy map:\n\nThink in  rst person from the user’s perspective. You can create an empathy map with real users if you have access to them, or do it with your project team going on assumptions.\n\nUsing this template, answer the following items from the perspective of your persona as they attempt to achieve their goal:\n\n1. Think/feel - what really counts, major preoccupations, worries/aspirations\n2. see - what the personas perceives from the people and in uences around them\n3. say/do - what is the persona saying/doing; how they interact with others, appearance\n4. Hear - what are coworkers saying, what are managers saying, what are clients saying, what are friends saying\n5. Pain - what are the persona’s obstacles, frustrations, fears\n6. gain - what are the persona’s wants and needs, obstacles, metrics of success\n\n## When to create an empathy map?\n\nYou should start creating empathy maps at the beginning of any project or major iteration of a project.\n\n## Why create an empathy map?\n\nEmpathy maps are valuable to teams in the early stages of a project by clearly depicting pain points in a process or system that currently exist and cause the user frustration. This allows the team to acknowledge those problems and create resolutions for them early in the project.",

Personas are used to help guide decisions about products, features, navigation, interactions, and visual design. The creation of personas allows the team to stay focused on what is important by recognizing the needs of the user. \n\nAssumption Based Personas: These are a great way to start. These allow you to begin the process of understanding what you may think the user is wanting, frustrated with, and how what is being built will be used or interacted with.\n\nUser Based Personas: These are created from interviewing a series of real people and capturing descriptions about behavior patterns goals, skills, attitudes, and environments that helps identify these users. This is the most accurate type of persona and brings the most value.\n\n## How to create a persona:\n\nFirst, identify and interview your target users with relevant questions regarding your project.
